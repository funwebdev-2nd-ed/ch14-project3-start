# Fundamentals of Web Development, 2nd Edition
### Chapter 14 [Databases], Project 3 [Art]

Demonstrate not only your ability to generate dynamic pages from multiple database
tables, but also the ability to design a solution that minimizes code duplication.
This project also makes use of a CSS Framework called SemanticUI. The results
when finished will look similar to that shown in Figure 14.37.

Note: To configure database connection, edit includes/art-config.inc.php

For some environments, you may need to initialize your MySQL once before creating and populating the data. In
Cloud9, you do so via the command:
```
mysql-ctl start
```

You will need to create and populate the database before running this code. To do so, you will need to 
use either the command line or the MySQLAdmin tool. 

For instance, in Cloud9, here are the appropriate commands:

```
mysql-ctl cli
source art-small.sql
```
